#Fully translated and cleaned up by Sugoi Soy Boy. Fuck off MTLing monkeys.

*TL note, yes I'm fucking aware PassportLona/item_name (Lona's ID Paper)'s dates do not match the CHT (Chinese) version's date numbers. This was purposely done by the game's developer so YOU can experience the joy of playing as a 'one year old baby' AND for us to enjoy the hypocripsy and tears of western, virtue signaling, woke, social justice warriors who can't tell the difference between real life and fiction. (YOU)
Shut the fuck up about it already.

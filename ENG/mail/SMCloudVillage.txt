father's last words

\}I warned them.\n
At that time, I foolishly thought that I was the smartest in the village.
With more and more chaos out there, there's bound to be not enough food.
I told everyone to stockpile food immediately, but everyone thought that Noll Island had three harvests a year, and it was impossible to be short of food.
\n
\n
Then you see, sure enough, they had nothing to eat.
The villagers began to snatch the passing people and vendors. Aren't they afraid of being discovered by the gentlemen in the city?
\n
Some outsiders came in, and they were definitely not city guards.
I couldn't leave the village, they were afraid that I would sue the officials.
\n
\n
I was wrong, I should have left here in the first place.
Daqiang who lived across the street was killed, and those outsiders said he was hiding food. His wife kept screaming all night.
I'm terrified, what if they find out I still have food in my house?
It's too late to say anything now, I heard that Nuoer Town has closed its gates.
If we leave early, or don't prepare food.....
\n
\n
Those people started trying to get my wife's attention.
\n
\n
I failed and my wife died, but at least my son escaped.
If you see this letter, tell me son.
Don't think about revenge, just live well. Better to be a livestock than to lose your life.

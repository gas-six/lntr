\}To whom it may concern.
\n
    I have heard that many of you
love difficult challenges.
In these hard times that we live
in, Adventurers like you are
dear to my heart.
\n
    If you could use your experience
for the good of Noer Town, our city
would be a better place to live.
\n
    I would love to meet each and
everyone of you who are willing
to talk to me. You can find me
at the golden bar during
the daytime.

Task well done

\}To Lona Falldin
\n
    You did a very good job back there,
getting rid of those troublemakers
for me. Your actions have helped restore
stability in Noer.
\n
    I must honestly apologize for
underestimating you.\n
I had doubts that you could ever make it.
\n
    It is clear that in the future more
task like this will appear, these
are not praiseworthy tasks, but It's
a job that has to be done.
\n
    Of course the rewards will be
much greater as well.
\n
   The People of Noer hope that they
can live in peace and stability.
And you are the one that can
make that dream come true.
\n
\n
\n
Yours sincerely, Milo.

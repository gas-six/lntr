Being born as a mixed-race, that is a curse I will
always have to bear.
\n
Monsters... suddenly invaded the monastery from
downtown. I should have been scared. I should've
felt bad.
\n
But, I didn't. They slaughtered everyone who've ever
wronged me, bullied me and hurt me.
And yet... I'm still alive.
\n
Perhaps it's a gift from the Saint?
Or from the evil Lies and Sins themselves?
Either way, I thank you and praise thee.
\n
The priests are all dead now, their deaths were
horrible. Hehe, good.
They deserved it, all the torture I had to endure
from them. The touching... The rape...
I believed in them, I trusted them!
But they betrayed me...
I hate them...
\n
I'm glad they're dead...
Dead Dead DEAD DEAD DEADDEADDEAD!

I fled to Noer Town, I think I'm a part of the
first refugees to arrive here.
\n
I've managed to get a job, at some kind of a famous
tavern? They were the only place offering jobs
for mixed-races.
\n
I can spend some time here, but I still have to
find a way to leave this island.
The only way out of here is to make money.
I have to find a way,
even if it means selling my body...
\n

I'm the rat that can't be killed...
I've eaten nothing but rats for a month now,
I'm really sick of it.
\n
Besides rats, there are also squatters here.
I drove them away with a pitchfork that
I stole awhile back.
\n
To all the fuckers who've always looked down on me
because I'm a "Moot"?
Well, you're worse than me now.
\n
\C[4]1772.2.2\C[0]
Something red is appearing on the walls.
Like in Sybaris, it's a sign of the invasion.
Can't stay here for too long...
\n
\C[4]1772.2.3\C[0]
I'm pretty sure either rats or more squatters are
digging at the wall at the end of the sewer.
I can hear loud noises of something moving around.
\n
I'm going to go check it out now.

=The island's name rectification activity=
\}Citizens already know that Knoll Town is just a rural village attached to us.
Why is Noel Island still called Noel Island? The city named after the first person to discover the island?
Look, even their descendants don't live in Knoll. Why is it still called Noel Island?
Our grand prix, Paris, is already known as the first port capital in the civilized world!
We are asking to rename our island!
It will be called Sybaris Island!

I____Support the renaming of Nord Island to Sybaris Island.

\}Why!
That woman really thinks there is a way out?
She just took her child to die with those stupid men!
She's just a whore who takes adventage of men
that can only think with their cocks!
Why don't those men listen to me? 
No one will come to our rescue!
We should give our souls to the saints, 
that is our only salvation!
I am not wrong!
I am right!
I am not wrong!
It's all your fault!
You all deserve it!
I am not wrong!

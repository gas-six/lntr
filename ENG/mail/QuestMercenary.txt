\}Eastern Deepones\n
\n
A few days ago, a large group of Deepones ambushed the Northern Camp.
They seem to have adopted a siege tactic against us,
When have they used such \C[4]tactics\C[0]?
\n
It's way too suspicious,
It's as if someone is controlling them.
The Deepones aren't intelligent enough to be able to attack on a large scale.
But that's what's happening now...
Their actions seem to follow some sort of hive mind.

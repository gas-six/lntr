\}It was on that day, at the north gate of Noer,
that I last saw you.
All the months I've spent without you,
have made me miss you so much.
\n
I wrote to you every month, have you received
my letters?
I ask the sergeant everyday, but he says that
there's no reply from you.
I know that's a lie, most of them can't read and
write so I bet they just destroyed those letters.
\n
We can't have guests, there's no spare time and
some of these fuckers bully me for fun.
The army will never change it's nature of
messing around and bullying.
\n
All I have are memories of you and the days
we've spent together.
I can't see you nor hear your voice.
But I remember it clearly.
And this all drives me crazy.
\n
Miss you
Love you
Want to hug you
And kiss you
\n
Your love, John.

The following is my uncle's
address in Noer Town.\n
West District No. 6-4, Lane 9, Alley 8, Haibin Road

#No. 6-4, Aly. 8, Ln. 9, SeaCoast Rd., West Dist.

\}You've always been a good person.
And although we've had many happy memories,
I don't think that we fit together.
All these disasters got me thinking.
There wasn't a single day,
I wouldn't think about all that's
happened.
And while you were there, far away, your uncle was here for me.
He provided me with security
and I don't need to worry about the future anymore.
\n
I'm grateful for everything you sacrificed for me,
You're a good person, a really good person.
But what we had between us, is over.
I hope you'll understand.
\n
Regards, Marian.

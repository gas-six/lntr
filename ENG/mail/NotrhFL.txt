It has been a few months and every day is a torture for me.
We lost the south gate camp and the west gate, and the only people who came here were mercenaries who were worse than bandits.
Where are the troops you promised?

Forget about the hillbillies on the south coast, now even those smelly fish are riding on our heads?
But I can only do this for various supplies and equipment.
As long as I can provide more slaves they will ensure that I get what I want.
The morale problem can be solved by providing one or two slaves regularly for the soldiers to use.
Yes, I was selling people, but I had no choice at all.

They even seem to be somewhat established, who is leading them?

\}This is my suicide note...
but it's also a warning
to those who find it.
\n
When I first got lost in this forest, I was terrified.
I prayed to the Saints for help and guidance.
And then I found this place.
I was so grateful to the Saints!
My prayers had been answered!
But I had no idea the kind of hell that was waiting for me.
At first they seemed to be very friendly, provided me with a warm meal, Offered me a place to sleep.
I trusted them and let my guard down.
And that's when they DRUGGED ME...
THAT OLD HAG lured me with sweets.
By the time I had woken up, It was already too late
I was in chains and there was nothing I could do.
\n
*The handwriting begins to change and become crooked,
There are clear visible teardrops on the
paper that make further reading difficult.
\n
But the worst was yet to come... they let that THING! THAT DISGUSTING MONSTER,
RAPE ME... AND RAPE ME... AND RAPE ME...
DAY AFTER DAY...
I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS ANYMORE...
IF YOU FIND THIS NOTE I AM PROBABLY
DEAD... THIS IS MY ONLY WAY OUT
\n
\n
please don't let this happen to you...
do not STAY HERE!!!
\{DON'T BELIEVE THEM!!!
DON'T LET THEM DECEIVE YOU!!!

\}They thought they had caught me？
They were wrong！My brothers! Believe me！
They only captured our bodies！
The Saints will not forgive those who lie！
My people will follow me and I will guide them!
We shall meet in the temple of the Saints! And my
anger will burn those who lie!

To my only love
How could things become like this？
I think I have no other choice but to die.
But you have to live. Not only for me,
but for our children.
Go meet little Joey,
he will watch over you and our children,
He's the only person you can trust.

\CamCT\m[flirty]\PRF\C[0]\C[6]Lona：\C[0]    Can you tell me what's happening here?
\CamMP[Priest]\BonMP[Priest,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    We took on a quest of killing an abnormal animal of some sort, but inside this place awaiting us was no mere animal!
\CamMP[Priest]\BonMP[Priest,6]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    It's The Dark Gluttonous One!
\CamMP[KillerRabbit]\BonMP[Priest,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    The Gluttons will arrive with The Darkness and follow the Footsteps of Lies. They will devour everything in their way. 
\CamMP[KillerRabbit]\BonMP[Priest,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    Now, which chapter and section mentioned this...? Gah, I can't remember!
\CamMP[KillerRabbit]\BonMP[Priest,15]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    Look at its red eyes and white fur! This is a symbol of Sin!
\CamMP[Priest]\BonMP[Priest,6]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    We'll need \c[2] Holy Water\c[0]!\n \c[2]Holy Water\c[0] has the power to purify all evil,\n but I was kicked out of the church by the Saint's Association!
\CamMP[Priest]\BonMP[Priest,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]   Help me get some\n \c[2]Holy Water\c[0]! With it, I'll be able to defeat the monster!
\CamCT\m[serious]\Rshake\C[0]\C[6]Lona：\C[0]    No problem!

\CamMP[Priest]\BonMP[Priest,8]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    Oh Saint in heaven, bless the innocent with your grace!
\CamMP[Priest]\BonMP[Priest,8]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    Oh Saint in heaven, I pray for you to eliminate all Lies and Evil!
\CamMP[Priest]\BonMP[Priest,8]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    Praise the Saint!
\CamCT\m[confused]\PRF\C[0]\C[6]Lona：\C[0]    So, just sprinkling some over here should be enough?
\CamMP[Priest]\BonMP[Priest,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    Don't worry, this is now already a sanctuary of the Saint. Any evil beings or Lies that come here will be smited by the Saint!
\CamMP[Priest]\BonMP[Priest,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    Now then, we will need someone to distract the monster and lead it into the sanctuary.
\CamCT\m[wtf]\PRF\C[0]\C[6]Lona：\C[0]    ...Huh?
\CamMP[Priest]\BonMP[Priest,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    Little girl, it shall be you! GO! Follow in the footsteps of the Saint and lead evil to its demise!
\CamCT\m[shocked]\Rshake\C[0]\C[6]Lona：\C[0]    E-EHHH?! Me?!

priest/HolyWater3
\CamMP[Priest]\BonMP[Priest,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    Don't be afraid, go on! The Saint will protect you!
\CamCT\m[flirty]\PRF\C[0]\C[6]Lona：\C[0]    Ummm?


Lona/RabbitDed0
\CamMP[KillerRabbit]\narr The Saint's Holy Water was slippery and sour.
It made the rabbit tumble like a bag of flour.
The lil' bunny fell and bumped its head.
Not a moment later, it now lay dead...

\CamCT\m[flirty]\PRF\C[0]\C[6]Lona：\C[0]    No way! Did that really work?

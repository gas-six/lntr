Bobo is a prized breeding boar who has won many Pig Awards in Sybaris.
His stature and penis size is several times larger than that of a normal boar.
He seems to believe that Lona is a breeding sow and wishes to very much mate with this adorable and skinny piglet! ♥

Quest Term：Once
Bobo the Breeder is feeling sympathetic toward the adorable piglet and wishes to help her.
Bobo knows that he and this cute gilt in front of him are meant to be together! But, they both must first escape the clutches of the evil, hairless apes.
Once they're free and together again, Bobo and this sow will mate many times under the moonlight and start a family with her giving birth to plenty of their piglets!
Unfortunately, stupid Bobo wasn't aware that this breeding sow won't be able to conceive any of his piglets and make a happy family...

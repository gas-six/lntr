\CamCT\m[confused]\plf\PRF\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    What were those monsters we just fought?
\CamMP[officer]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\PLF\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    They're called the \c[6]Deepones\c[0]. Haven't you heard of them before?
\CamMP[officer]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\PLF\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    Next to pirates, the earliest colonists were most afraid of these monsters.
\CamMP[officer]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\PLF\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    The physical strength of a Deepone is so great that no man could face them without a weapon.
\CamMP[officer]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\PLF\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    They invade the living quarters late at night to attack the men and kidnap the women.
\CamMP[officer]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\PLF\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    What happens after they're taken away? Well, it's no different than the result with the Orkinds...
\CamMP[officer]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\PLF\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    In fact, women like you should be extra careful...
\CamCT\m[fear]\plf\PRF\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    Me......?
\CamCT\m[flirty]\plf\PRF\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    In other words, try not to get caught by them?
\CamMP[officer]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\PLF\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    Yes, I haven't seen them for years. I thought they went extinct.
\CamMP[officer]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\PLF\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    Now the entire swampland to the east is under their control.
\CamMP[officer]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\PLF\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    The Deepones must have spread with the Black Mist, or perhaps they're the ghosts of past fishermen.
\CamMP[officer]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\PLF\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    I'm not sure how long I'll be here, so find out for yourself.
\CamCT\m[pleased]\plf\PRF\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    Alright then, thank you.

officer/opt_FireControlSys
\CamCT\m[confused]\plf\PRF\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    This is called the... Overlord M405 Cannon?
\CamCT\m[flirty]\plf\PRF\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    Can this be mass produced? If it's so powerful, aren't we able to take back Sybaris?
\CamMP[officer]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\PLF\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    Under current circumstances, that's not possible. This is the only model and training a group of soldiers to use such device will take many months.
\CamMP[officer]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\PLF\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    Even if the capitol has the ability to mass-produce this weapon, there's no ammo supply...
\CamMP[officer]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\PLF\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    Most importantly... Many of us are illiterate.
\CamCT\m[confused]\plf\PRF\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    ...I see.

\CamMP[Cannon]\BonMP[Cannon,19]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\Lshake\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    That's it! Go and operate that cannon!
\CamMP[Cannon]\m[shocked]\plf\Rshake\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    How would I even know how to use such a thing?
\CamMP[Cannon]\BonMP[officer,15]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\Lshake\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    This is no time for jokes! Can't you see? Shoot at the enemies until they're dead!
\CamMP[officer]\BonMP[officer,6]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\Lshake\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    Here they come! There's no time!
\CamCT\m[fear]\plf\Rshake\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    What? Who's coming?!
\CamMP[officer]\BonMP[officer,15]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\Lshake\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    GO! Stop wasting time!

\CamMP[officer]\SETpl[Lawbringer]\Lshake\prf\c[4]Artillery Officer：\c[0]    The ammunition for the cannon was an additional test item provided by the creator of this weapon.

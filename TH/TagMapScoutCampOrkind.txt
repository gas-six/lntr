\m[serious]\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    This is the place, I can smell the monster's foul odor from here...
\m[irritated]\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    It seems like their guards are on high alert. \CamMP[DasWatcher]

CommonConvoyTarget/Hev0
\SETpr[OrcCaveEvent] Inside this small and foul cave, the condition of the victims looked very poor.
For the Orkinds, neither age nor appearance was a concern. As long as the female can conceive, they'll continue impregnating her.
The victims seem to have been subjected to prolonged sexual abuse. Most of them look to either be losing their sanity or are deceased.
As for the merchant's daughter, she was covered in semen and filth.
Her stomach was full of wrinkles from\n constantly giving birth, and she seemed\n to have been abused by Orkinds for a long time.
Lona couldn't tell if she was sane or not. If she wasn't sane, Lona would probably have to give up on the rescue...

CommonConvoyTarget/begin0
\m[serious]\PRF\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    She's still alive!
\prf\c[4]Merchant's Daughter：\c[0]    \..\..\..\..Uwuughuuu... *Whimper*...

CommonConvoyTarget/beginOPT
\plf\c[4]Merchant's Daughter：\c[0]    Ughnnn... W-Who are... you...? \optB[Just someone passing by...,I've come here to save you!]

CommonConvoyTarget/Arrivel
\prf\c[4]Merchant's Daughter：\c[0]    Thank you so much! Because of you, I'm still alive.
\m[triumph]\PRF\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    You're welcome!
\prf\c[4]Merchant's Daughter：\c[0]    I shall return back to my father now, take care.

CommonConvoyTarget/Arrivel1
\m[confused]\PRF\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    I should return back to the guild now.

CommonConvoyTarget/CommonConvoyTarget

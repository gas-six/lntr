\CBct[8]\m[confused]\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    Huh...? T-That's right.
\CBid[-1,20]\prf\c[4]Traveler：\c[0]    Haha, I'm about to leave this island soon. Used to be a mercenary, till I took an arrow to the knee.

GuideTheWorld/Choose
\m[confused]\CBid[-1,20]\prf\c[4]Traveler：\c[0]    Just think of it as an old man simply giving some advice to a newcomer. Is there anything you'd like to know about?

GuideTheWorld/end1
\CBid[-1,20]\prf\c[4]Traveler：\c[0]    You best find a way to leave this place soon, staying at Noer Island is just a death sentence. Once the island is destroyed, you'll be joining its grave!

GuideTheWorld/end2
\CBid[-1,9]\prf\c[4]Traveler：\c[0]    Ah! Yes!
\CBid[-1,20]\prf\c[4]Traveler：\c[0]    If you ain't afraid of a bit of danger, you ought to visit the \C[6]Central Noer Market\C[0] at night. Heard there be some good stuff being sold that might be useful to you.

\CBid[-1,20]\prf\c[4]Traveler：\c[0]    Me? Yep! That's right! I'm what's known as a \c[6]Mixed-Race\c[0].
\CBid[-1,20]\prf\c[4]Traveler：\c[0]    From the Elves of the forests, to the Dwarves of the mountains, my blood even contains the history of the nomads from the Deserts. I'm just THAT mixed.
\CBid[-1,20]\prf\c[4]Traveler：\c[0]    No matter where we go, we are never welcomed. It's because many folks think that our blood is tainted and filthy.
\CBid[-1,20]\prf\c[4]Traveler：\c[0]    Before these disasters started occurring, people would blame us as the cause for Sins to exist.
\CBid[-1,20]\prf\c[4]Traveler：\c[0]    But now it seems that the refugees of \C[6]Sybaris\C[0] are the real problem for what's happening.
\CBct[8]\m[tired]\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    ......
\CBid[-1,6]\prf\c[4]Traveler：\c[0]    Errr... Sorry about that, my old habits are acting up again.

GuideTheWorld/opt_TeamUp
\CBid[-1,20]\prf\c[4]Traveler：\c[0]    You might be able to find yourself some potential companions in inns and taverns.
\CBid[-1,20]\prf\c[4]Traveler：\c[0]    Each companion's faction, combat type, duration, positions, and demands or costs are all different.
\CBid[-1,20]\prf\c[4]Traveler：\c[0]    Be sure to pay attention to these things, especially the person's position and duration of service.
\CBid[-1,20]\prf\c[4]Traveler：\c[0]    There can only be a single \C[6]Front\C[0] and \C[6]Rear\C[0] companion with you.
\CBid[-1,20]\prf\c[4]Traveler：\c[0]    Over time, once the companion's duration days reaches 0, they will leave your service.

\CBct[1]\m[shocked]\Rshake\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    \{HUH?!\}
\CBct[8]\m[flirty]\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    \....Was it all...... \....Just a dream?

OP/b4Begin0
The Black Mist took everything from me.

OP/b4Begin1

OP/b4Begin2
My family...

OP/b4Begin3
I have nothing......

OP/begin0
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Ahh... You're finally here...!
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    I've been waiting a long time for you to arrive. You were sent by the guild to get rid of the filthy, giant rats. Yes?
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    The vermin have been infesting this area and mutating since January...
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Follow me.

OP/begin1
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Now... What was that child's name......?
\CBmp[teacher,8]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    \..\..\..That's right! \c[6]Feira\c[0]!
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Such a sweet girl... I wanted her to be my herald, but her rage consumed her and clouded her judgment.
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    I thought I could be the one to enlighten her, but it seems I was far too late......
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Now that you're here, I hope you'll be the one to finally help me with my pest problem.
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Take a look around.

OP/begin2
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    What a sad, cruel world. Yes?
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    These poor souls ran away from \c[6]Sybaris\c[0] and lost their homes, just like you.
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    But you're different, you haven't given up and lost hope. Right?
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Come on...

OP/begin4
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    It's really dark in here, huh? Almost reminds you of the \c[6]Black Mist\c[0] that dreadful night...
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Apologies, I didn't mean to bring up such a horrid disaster.
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Come, go ahead and light this firepit for me.
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Justice will serve as the light shining in the darkness, driving away all evil and sin...

OP/begin5
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Much better now, yes?
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    I assure you, the darkness of that night won't ever happen again.

OP/begin6
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Hmmm?  Wait a second\....\.... What is this?

OP/begin7
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Seems you forgot some things here.
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Go ahead and pick them up, they belong to you after all.

OP/begin8
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    ......I just thought those two had an argument and spilled something in my home.
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    I didn't expect to see everything be so miserable and ruined once I returned.
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    But, I'm sure I know just who the culprit is...
\CBmp[teacher,8]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    .....Hmmm?
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Have you finished collecting all of your belongings?

\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Ah, yes! I just hate it when I'm busy with something and have to deal with another problem.
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Why should I be the one to fix the trouble they've created?
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    Perhaps they did all of this on purpose...?

OP/begin11
\CBmp[teacher,8]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    \....\....\....

\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    She must have built this to prevent vagrants from entering her territory.
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    ...But the irony was that she's a homeless vagrant as well.
\CBmp[teacher,20]\c[4]Unknown：\c[0]    As cruel as it sounds, this was her destiny. But what about you? What does fate have waiting for you...?

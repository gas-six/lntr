\CamCT\Bon[6]\m[wtf]\PRF\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    What's going on here?
\CamMP[YellingGuard]\BonMP[YellingGuard,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    We hired a group of mercenaries to rescue the people still trapped in Sybaris.
\CamMP[YellingGuard]\BonMP[YellingGuard,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    The journey was uneventful, until we arrived here....
\CamMP[YellingGuard]\BonMP[YellingGuard,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    We're under siege by a large number of deepones.
\CamMP[YellingGuard]\BonMP[YellingGuard,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    They're always close, all the time, and they'll sneak up on us if we drop our guard.
\CamMP[YellingGuard]\BonMP[YellingGuard,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    I haven't slept for a few days... Our strength and morale is at it's limits.
\CamMP[YellingGuard]\BonMP[YellingGuard,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    That's right! You can help me! She was also snatched up by those fucking deepones...
\CamCT\Bon[6]\m[shocked]\Rshake\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    Who?
\CamMP[YellingGuard]\BonMP[YellingGuard,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    She's my girl! Please, save her! We're all out of hands!

\CamMP[YellingGuard]\BonMP[YellingGuard,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    Thank you! Thank you miss!
\CamMP[YellingGuard]\BonMP[YellingGuard,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    After we fought off a wave of Deepone attacks four nights ago, it was her turn to keep watch.
\CamMP[YellingGuard]\BonMP[YellingGuard,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    When we woke up, she was gone! Footprints were found and the stench of fish lingered in the air nearby!
\CamMP[YellingGuard]\BonMP[YellingGuard,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    The scouts followed the footprints to the Northeast and found a fishkind's temple ruins.
\CamMP[YellingGuard]\BonMP[YellingGuard,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    I know what the Deepones take women for!
\CamMP[YellingGuard]\BonMP[YellingGuard,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    She must still be alive! Absolutely!
\CamCT\Bon[6]\m[serious]\PRF\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    Yeah! I'm on my way!
\CamMP[YellingGuard]\BonMP[YellingGuard,20]\prf\c[4]Mercenary：\c[0]    Saint protect you!

system/SneakT1
\SndLib[sys_DialogNarr]\bg[bg_TutorialSneak1]\ph\{\C[6]Hide\C[0]
\bg[bg_TutorialSneak2] You can \C[6]Sneak\C[0] by pressing the (Default：CTRL) key.
\bg[bg_TutorialSneak3] The characters in the game have vision and directionality.
\bg[bg_TutorialSneak4] If a NPC/creature faces Lona, she will be spotted with a high probability.
\bg[bg_TutorialSneak5] However, if Lona is \C[6]sneaking\C[0], the chances of her being detected is reduced.

system/SneakT2
\SndLib[sys_DialogNarr]\bg[bg_TutorialTerrain1] \{\C[4]Terrain\C[0]
\bg[bg_TutorialTerrain2] The terrain in the game will affect the character's vision.
\bg[bg_TutorialTerrain3] If Lona is in tall grass, it will be harder for the opponent to see Lona.
\bg[bg_TutorialTerrain4] If Lona is behind a high terrain, the other side can barely see her.
\bg[bg_TutorialTerrain5] If Lona is behind a wall, she will be completely invisible.
\bg[bg_TutorialTerrain6] But be careful, different creatures may have different natural judgment methods.

system/SneakT3
\SndLib[sys_DialogNarr]\bg[bg_TutorialThrow1] \{\C[2]Throw\C[0]
\bg[bg_TutorialThrow2] Lona's basic skill, \C[2]Throw\C[0], can lure NPCs/enemies away.
\bg[bg_TutorialThrow3] Using \C[2]Throw\C[0] helps distract NPCs, allowing Lona to quickly sneak away or hide.
\bg[bg_TutorialThrow4] \C[2]Thrown rocks\C[0] will distract them for a short period of time, NPCs/enemies will return to their previous position after the effect ends.
\bg[bg_TutorialThrow5_ENG] \C[2]Scoutcraft\C[0] will increase how sneaky Lona is when she \C[2]Sneaks\C[0] (Default：CTRL).
\bg[bg_TutorialThrow5_ENG] Lona is unable to properly \C[2]Sneak\C[0] from danger if her \C[2]Scoutcraft\C[0] is too low.
\bg[bg_TutorialThrow6_ENG] In order to use basic \C[2]Sneak\C[0], increase your \C[2]Scoutcraft\C[0] to 5 or higher.
\CBmp[FeiraCropse,19]\bgoff Try combining \C[2]Throw\C[0] and \C[6]Sneak\C[0] to distract your enemies and acquire that Short Sword!

Tutorial/Trap

\CBmp[trap,19]......
\CBmp[trap,19]...
\CBct[1]\m[shocked]\Rshake\c[6]Lona：\c[0]    !!!!!!
\SndLib[sys_DialogNarr]\bg[bg_TutorialTrap1]\ph \{\C[2]Traps!\C[0]
When a trap is set up, the trap's effect will be activated when a NPC/creature or Lona is in the same position as the trap.
\bg[bg_TutorialTrap2]You can ignite or trigger a trap from afar by \C[2]throwing\C[0] rocks at it.
\bg[bg_TutorialTrap3]Traps can also be interacted with to be disassembled, but Lona's Survival must be greater than the attack power of the trap.
Watch where you step, some traps are very deadly! \bgoff

Tutorial/Sap
\SndLib[sys_DialogNarr]\bg[bg_TutorialSap1]\ph \{\C[2]Backstabs and Stuns.\C[0]
Most attacks from behind will deal higher damage. Attacks from behind are noted as a "Backstab".
\bg[bg_TutorialSap2]If a NPC is not in combat and has no target, attacking them from behind will cause a long-term stun effect.
\bg[bg_TutorialSap3]The stunned NPC will lose their sense of direction, and the next attack on them will be equivalent to a Backstab.
When a stunned NPC takes damage again, they will recover from their stunned status.\bgoff

Tutorial/STA
\SndLib[sys_DialogNarr]\bg[bg_TutorialSTA]\ph Hint：STA (Stamina)
When STA is below 0, many skills will be unusable.
Lona will also begin to crawl instead of walk due to exhaustion.
You can set up skill buttons in the Skill page of the main menu.
Try to set up and use the Rest button to relax or go to sleep.
Rest is divided into Relax and Sleep. You can press and hold SHIFT or R2 to perform different actions.
Relaxing will decrease Food to heal Stamina or Health if Stamina is full. Relaxing will not make time pass by.
Sleeping will cause time to pass and heal certain injuries, restore Stamina, and restore or reduce Health according to Lona's \c[4]Food\c[0] status.
\bgoff\narr Beware! Don't starve!

Tutorial/SAT
\SndLib[sys_DialogNarr]\bg[bg_TutorialSAT]\ph Hint：Food
When Lona is starving, health will be reduced every time she sleeps/time passes.
Enter the Item page of the main menu to use various items and food.
Try to keep Food levels high before each nap. \bgoff

Tutorial/About2hWeapon
\SndLib[sys_DialogNarr]\bg[bg_Equips]\ph It's a Pitchfork! A two-handed weapon.
It has an attack distance of 2 tiles wherever Lona faces, but it cannot attack at the area Lona is standing on.
It is a piercing weapon that can slow down enemies.
Enter the Equipment page of the main menu to adjust Lona's equipment.
Visit the equipment screen and try it out. \bgoff

Tutorial/LVL
\SndLib[sys_DialogNarr]\bg[bg_TutorialLVL]\ph Level up!
Each level up will grant you one Trait point.
Enter the Trait page of the main menu to assign your Trait points.
Used Trait points cannot be restored. Spend them wisely! \bgoff

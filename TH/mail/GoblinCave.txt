Entering the cave, the first thing that catches your eye are the mountains of garbage piled up on either side. These heaps contain a mix of animal carcasses, human remains, and various rotting food. Above the entrance hangs a banner made from human skin, adorned with reproductive organ illustrations.
 
As you venture deeper into the cave, the ground becomes increasingly muddy and foul-smelling. Scattered everywhere are bones, body parts, and all manner of filth that the Orkinds use as decorations or food sources. In the depths of the cave lies a vast space filled with putrid odors and sights too horrific to describe.
 
This is their gathering place, where they conduct rituals and engage in entertainment. The floor is covered in a thick layer of mud and excrement, marked by countless footprints. In this environment, Orkinds move about as if they were fish in water. Their feet and bodies are caked with mud and filth, but they pay it no mind. In fact, they take pride in these things, seeing them as symbols of power and fertility.
 
Here you can witness various activities: some Orkinds roughhousing and tearing at each other, others torturing their captives. The air is filled with screams, cries, and sounds too vile to listen to.

In Noer Town's north, a cave originally used as a watchtower was overrun by Orkinds. These malevolent creatures tunneled their way in from below, launching an internal assault that successfully captured this place. Now, it has become a hellish den reeking of decay, blood, and lust.
 
Orkinds' reproductive method is their most terrifying feature. They require living females as breeding stock to ensure the survival of their race. These captives will endure endless torment and rape until they exhaust themselves or die.
 
Orkind semen has an extraordinary nature. It not only causes rapid pregnancy but also introduces a latent infection into its victims. This infection alters the women's physiology, making them more suitable for bearing Orkind offspring. However, it also means they can never escape their dependence on Orkind seed.
 
The prisoners are confined in a subterranean chamber filled with excrement and rotting flesh. Every day, they are forced to mate with countless Orkinds, whose insatiable lust knows no bounds. These creatures torment the victims in various ways, from brutal penetrations to sadistic use of tools for sexual torture.
 
In this hellish environment, the women's bodies undergo horrific transformations. Their wombs expand endlessly to accommodate more and more Orkind young. Their breasts also grow larger and more suitable for lactation, meeting the nutritional needs of their offspring.
 
As time passes, the victims' minds are utterly shattered. They lose all sense of self, becoming mere fleshly automatons that exist only to breed and obey. When they can no longer produce young, the Orkinds will consider them food, devouring them alive in a terrifying feast.
 
A small number of survivors who manage to escape will continue to experience physical changes, turning into nothing more than living wombs for the sole purpose of reproduction.

In the distant Noer Town to the northeast, there is a natural cave. This serves as an important supply base for the Orkind invasion of Noer Town, a labyrinthine underground world.
 
Upon entering the cave, you are immediately overwhelmed by a powerful, nausea-inducing stench. It's not just ordinary rot or mold; it's a unique blend of excrement, decaying flesh, and various filth. Orkinds have an extraordinary fondness for waste, viewing it as symbols of power and status.
 
At the cave entrance, heaps of garbage and body parts line both sides. Above them hang various animal skulls, with a central banner made from human leather adorned with Orkind-specific genitalia and sperm patterns. These are their trophies and emblems.
 
As you venture deeper into the cave, you'll find the ground covered in a thick layer of mud, bloodstains, and all manner of excrement. Orkinds live here, their activities continually adding to this filth. You can see rotting meat, bones, and discarded organs scattered everywhere.
 
In the depths of the cave lies a large chamber, which can be called the "Great Hall." This is where the Orkinds gather, conducting various rituals and activities. The floor is strewn with decaying flesh, body parts, and all manner of waste, exuding an indescribable stench.
 
Within this cave, you'll find numerous captives - humans and other creatures - chained up, their bodies covered in scars, grime, and terrifying markings. Orkinds use their own waste and blood to paint various designs on these victims as symbols of ownership.
 
In the deepest parts of the cave, there are remnants of other Orkind tribes. They war with each other but share a common love for filth and cruelty. This is a forgotten corner of the world, a realm of darkness, evil, and despair.
 
If you wish to explore this cave, prepare yourself mentally. You will encounter horrific sights, including tortured humans, animal carcasses, and Orkind's twisted rituals. It is truly a hell on earth, filled with Orkind-specific filth and malevolence.

In a cave located east of the town of Noer, in the marshy swamps, the Orkinds have established their lair. In this cave, there is an ongoing and relentless war between the Orkinds and the FishKind. Despite being at a disadvantage, the Orkinds continue to fight for territory.
 
The atmosphere within the cave is thick with decay, sexual assault, and torment. The entrance is blocked by rotting flesh and corpses, adorned with human skulls and animal bones - trophies of the Orkind's victories.
 
In this society, power and strength dictate everything. The strongest Orkind becomes the leader, while those who are weaker or in lower positions often become victims of sexual violence.
 
A group of special Orkinds known as Shaman possess dark powers. They use filthy and impure substances to perform terrifying rituals, further corrupting the already hellish environment with their black magic.
 
The cave is filled with various treasures - gold, silver, jewels, and human remains. These items serve as symbols of the Orkinds' conquests and dominance over the outside world.
 
In a hidden corner, the Orkinds conduct experiments on their captives. These experiments often involve reproduction, diseases, or horrific mutations.

Male Victims

Unlike female victims who may be kept alive as breeding stock, males face a far more brutal fate. Their end is often swift and violent.
 
When a male falls into the clutches of a Orkind tribe, his suffering begins immediately. The Orkinds will first subject him to repeated sexual assaults, using their grotesque genitals to violate every orifice of his body. This degradation serves as both a form of entertainment for the Orkinds and a means to assert dominance over their prey.
 
After hours of torment, depending on the tribe's whims, the male victim's fate is sealed. The most common end is being roasted alive on a spit. The Orkinds will first impale him with a thick wooden stake through his anus,
ensuring he remains upright and conscious throughout the process. They then proceed to cook him over an open fire, often seasoning him with their own urine or excrement for added flavor.
 
Some tribes prefer the more primal method of eating their victims raw, tearing into still-living flesh with their teeth and claws. This practice is particularly common among smaller, more feral groups who lack the patience to
build fires. The victim's screams echo through the cave as they are slowly dismembered and devoured.
 
Regardless of the method chosen, the male victim's death is always prolonged and excruciatingly painful. His last moments are spent in unimaginable agony, his body torn apart or burned alive while still conscious. The Orkinds take great pleasure in these acts, viewing them as both a source of sustenance and a form of entertainment.
 
The taste of human flesh is considered a delicacy among the Orkinds, and they often share their meals with one another, passing around choice morsels like trophies. The remains of their victims are left to rot or scattered for scavengers.

At the western city gate of Sybaris, there once stood a human military camp. This was a line of defense that protected civilians from pirate raids. However, everything changed with the arrival of the Black Mist.
 
Now, this camp has been occupied by Orkinds. Their leader, a massive and fearsome creature named Gorbuto, has turned it into his new lair. Unlike other Orkinds, Gorbuto possesses extraordinary intelligence and ambition.
 
The Orkinds here are no longer mere primitives wielding stones and clubs. After seizing this stronghold, they have begun to use human equipment. Armor, swords, bows and arrows, even simple traps and defensive structures now form their new arsenal of warfare.

Gorbuto sits in a chair made from human leather, surveying his domain. This room was once the command center of a fort, but now it reeked with the putrid stench and blood-soaked atmosphere characteristic of Orkind lairs.  He is contemplating his next move.
 
He enjoys wearing women prisoners as living ornaments, using thick metal rings to pierce through their breasts, bellies, vaginas, necks, and wrists, securing them tightly to his body. These women are forced into constant sexual contact with him for 24 hours a day, enduring both his relentless rapes and the physical burden of being used as human shields.
 
Gorbuto's penis is monstrously large, as thick as an arm. He uses this terrifying phallus to brutally impale and tear apart his victims until they are literally split open from crotch to chest. The sheer size of his member not only shatters their internal organs but also leaves grotesque wounds on their genitals.
 
He has a particular fondness for impaling, often using wooden stakes or metal pipes to penetrate through the anuses of his victims and display them as macabre decorations in his grand hall. Other Orkinds have come to call him 
"Spear King" due to this twisted habit.
 
Gorbuto has withstood countless human assaults on his territory, each time solidifying his rule over these lands. However, the recent food shortage is a significant concern for him. Despite this, he continues to cling tightly to the female prisoner hanging from his body, forcing her to keep producing more Orkind offspring.
 
This is one of the most powerful Orkinds on the island of Nolr, and no person or creature dares challenge his authority. He reigns supreme as the absolute tyrant in this terrifying world.

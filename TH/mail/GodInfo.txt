\}It was a dark and stormy night when it began...
Jimmy's family member had been murdered by
Dogeshuna.
\n
This black-haired protagonist who lost
his family member also lost the duel when
fighting Dogeshuna.
Dogeshuna even stole away and slept with his
childhood sweetheart.
\n
One day, Master Yarizo told Jimmy that he must avenge
his lost ones.
Jimmy hesitated at first.
But then agreed to go find Dogeshuna so he could
get revenge and avenge his loved ones.
\n
Battling again, the protagonist uses the power
of justice that has been honed during his
period of suffering from Dogeshuna.
\n
Jimmy's powers defeated Dogeshuna
and his evil powers were weakened.
However... During this ultimate battle,
Jimmy's left testicle was unfortunately
blown apart by Dogeshuna.
\n
But even so, Jimmy decided to forgive Dogeshuna.
Because Dogeshuna also had a family member.
Dogeshuna also felt the justice and
attraction for Jimmy.
\n
Jimmy and Dogeshuna were together
and found true love at last.
\n
\n
The end.

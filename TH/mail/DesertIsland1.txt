DesertIsland1/Text
\}I am Sybaris, and we fled to the port the day it happened.
The ship accepted us. But unfortunately, we hit the rocks.
We came to this island to wait for rescue.
Of course, nothing happened and the miracle of the saints was just a lie.
\n
The food in our hands ran out quickly, and we tried to catch fish, but there was still not enough food.
We tried to eat some boxes of dried flowers in the ship's cargo.
\n
\n
\n
\n
Saints, save us.
We shouldn't eat those red flowers.
\n

That woman committed suicide because she couldn't accept herself as a sex beast.
\n
\n
\n
\n
God, what the hell are we doing?
\n
\n
\n
\n
We buried her, and no one can accept themselves desecrating the corpse.
\n
\n
\n
\n
right! Dig her out, or there's nothing left to fuck.
\n
\n
\n
\n
All she has left is a bunch of skeletons, which can no longer be used.
My dick is so itchy, I really want to penetrate it.

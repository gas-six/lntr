\}We were attacked by monsters while fleeing, and my wife was captured by those damned monsters.
I used all my possessions to hire some warriors to try to rescue her.
As a result, as you can see, I failed. I cannot save my wife.
Don't tell my daughter.
she called\C[4]Mary\C[0], you should be able to find her in One Piece Castle.
Tell her we're waiting for her in Knoll.

It's been a successful research day!
Can they impregnate humans?
Are they a different kind of human race?
Were they humans once before?
Why are there only males?
\n

Dad was killed by one. They cut his belly open,
wrapped his intestines around their wiener.
And then penetrated father's anus.
\n
They don't seem to care about gender?
My father's screams excited me.
\n
I killed the cute creature and buried it with
my father. I hope that they can become
a couple in the future!
\n
My wiener is hard.
\n
\C[4]1772.01.06\C[0]
Mom is crazy now, she called me a monster and a
demon.
What she said made me so sad... So I buried her
with Dad and his lover!
I hope they'll be a happy family together!
\n

When I arrived in Noer, I bought a clinic.
As soon it was open for business,
people rushed to visit me.
Perhaps I should try to buy some slaves for my
study and research?
\n
\C[4]1772.01.12\C[0]
The basement is now clean and ready!
Next, I will expand my collection.
\n
\C[4]1772.01.13\C[0]
It seems the green-skins are also afraid of that
red kelp.
I thought that they would be good friends...
What exactly are these red kelps?
\n
\C[4]1772.01.14\C[0]
Does their semen affect the uterus
in humans and other races?
\n
Maybe I can make a fortune with the results!
I'll be rich!
Elise will make a fortune in Noer!
\n
\C[4]1772.01.16\C[0]
My theory was correct.
Although there are no similarities in appearance,
the green-skins are the same.
Except for their semen.
\n
They can be classified as a half-human species,
while their semen is almost like a parasite.
\n
Their semen can fertilize itself in the eggs of any
female humanoid species, and use them to reproduce
and give birth to their children.
Maybe this explains the lack of
female green-skins???
\n
\C[4]1772.02.10\C[0]
After refining their bodily fluids,
I injected the mixture into the subject's brain.
They were sooo obedient and cute!
They obeyed all of my orders and even licked
my wiener!
That was really fun.
\n
Some dumb girl appeared in my clinic today. I knew at a glance
that she would be the perfect mother.
\n
Perhaps she will allow me to perform various
interesting experiments on her body?
I'm so excited, just thinking about it makes
my pee pee hard!

Deepone sample

EliseResearch2/Text
\}I received a new test subject from Fishtopia
just a few days ago.
This specimen is a lot different from the Fishkind at
the port and the East.
It has a vagina and an uterus,
surely it must be a female?
I can see many human-like similarities.
But upon further inspection, the uterus
shows the subject has no ovaries.
Does this mean the Fishkind cannot
reproduce with each other?
Is there any explanation as to why there are only
males in the Fishkind species?
\n
Today I decided to test an experiment with a
flesh monster's fluids.
\n
What's going to happen once the flesh
monster's bodily fluid is injected into the
Fishkind specimen's uterus?
The results of the experiment were tumor-like
with bumps all over the uterus.
So, why did the stupid girl have no reaction to
the fluid she drank for me?
Perhaps the flesh monster's body fluids do not
affect humans?
\n
UUUGGGHHH---~~~
There's just way too many problems and
not enough answers!
I must go to the Fishkind's island for my research.
Where is that buffoon? I need her to go to
Fishtopia with me.

Orkind Reproductive

EliseResearch3/Text
\}\{-Introduction-\}
Hello! I'm Elise Varnell, a researcher. Today, I want to take you into a mysterious and exciting world—the reproductive ways of the Orkind creatures, especially how they parasite on human women. This is a new exploration for me,
filled with excitement!
\n
1. Why Women Are the Targets of Orkind
Currently, Orkind creatures primarily target human women as hosts. First, their biological structure allowsfor continuous reproduction due to female bodies' abilities to conceive and breastfeed, providing an idealenvironment for parasitism. Additionally, Orkind semen has unique parasitic functions, enabling them tosurvive and reproduce within the female body. This type of parasitism isn't limited to reproductive organs butcan affect other systems like the liver and intestines, making women the perfect hosts for Orkind creatures.
Moreover, this parasitism extends beyond physical control to psychological and emotional aspects, leaving women unable to escape their situation.
\n
2. Orkind's Genitalia. Stink!
The genitalia of Orkind creatures are among the most striking features of their biology. Their reproductive organs resemble a combination of those of dogs and horses, covered in multiple warts and pus. These growths not only render their appearance extremely unpleasant but also facilitate the spread of disease during mating.
\n
3. Dual Urinary System
Orkind's urinary system is distinct from humans, featuring a dual-layered system. The outer layer is for excretion, while the inner layer is specialized for semen discharge, allowing efficient transfer into the host's uterus.
\n
4. How Inner Urinary Penetrates the Host's Uterus
Orkind's inner urinary tract is unique, enabling them to inject semen directly into the host's uterus. This process is extremely painful for the victim, potentially causing infection and tissue damage. The victim may lose consciousness during the experience.
\n
5. Semen Volume and the Suffering of the Victim
Orkind produce a large volume of semen in one ejaculation, which can exceed 300ml. Each mating session presents a significant challenge for the host, both physically through pain and mentally due to the forced nature of the encounter.
\n
6. A Hermaphroditic Parasite
Orkind semen is not typical sperm but a parasitic entity that can infect eggs and grow into new Orkind larvae within the host. This makes them not just sexual reproduducers but highly adaptive parasites.
\n
7. The Side Effects of Orkind Semen
The semen of Orkind creatures has dual effects. On the one hand, it provides nutrients and protection because it is rich in nutritional substances and antimicrobial properties. However, on the other hand, certain chemical compounds in the semen can induce dependency, causing women who come into contact with it to develop a desire for repeat encounters even unintentionally.
\n
This kind of parasitism extends beyond biological aspects to psychological control, rendering women unable to completely free themselves from the grasp of Orkind creatures. This observation highlights how these creatures use their semen not only for propagation but also as a mechanism to influence and manipulate their hosts' behavior and physiology.
\n
8. Potential Medical and Nutritional Uses of Orkind Semen
Despite its deadly nature for hosts, Orkind semen contains substances with potential medical benefits, such as pain relief and antibacterial effects. It is also rich in nutrients, making it a high-energy food source in extreme contexts.
\n
\{-Conclusion-\}
Today's research has revealed that the reproductive methods of Orkind creatures are not just biological curiosities but highly evolved survival strategies. Their ability to control women through semen is both fascinating and terrifying! I look forward to continuing my exploration of Orkind biology, including their social structures and cultural traditions, to assess if they could be suitable as domesticated animals.
\n
Thank you for listening! I hope today's discussion sparks some new thoughts and curiosity!

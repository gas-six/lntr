\}The plague is a lie! We are not sick!
Poverty is not a sickness!
\n
You can't lock us in here because of poverty!
You can't keep us down here because of objections!
I curse you! I curse the saints! I curse this world!
\n
No matter who you are! When you read this letter,
the world will be destroyed!

Sinner?

\}At first, we ate the mice and those who had recently died
Then we ate those who too weak to resist.
\n
In the end, we began to eat each other.
Saints, forgive us for our sins.

Desperate?

\}I know we will all die in here.
The question is how long until we do?
\n
I've never believed in saints before.
But if we can remain religious, at least the saints
will let us a rest after death.
\n
I tried to do what I could, but, unexpectedly, people
became extremely religious.
\n
They believed in everything I said, no matter
what.\n
\n
They will do whatever I want, it's as if I'm a Saint.
Maybe I'll get to live.

Liar?

\}Got to get out, just dig upwards.
The beggar who claimed to be a man of faith
believed that the grace of the saints could be
obtained only by staying here.
\n
All lies! they even sneaked attacks on my people!
They ate her!
They don't deserve to be called people at all.
\n
\n
\n
We must wage war! but there aren't many of us left.
Come on! You will despair! I want to eat you all.
We'll see who can live to the end.

\}Father says the outside world is evil.
Mother said that innocent people should not be born.
Liars are liars, and I no longer believe them.
\n
My parents are liars and I must eat him.
See how cute my child is.
\n
I Want to eat my baby, I have to eat him.
The saints will stand by my side.

Last words

CatacombMsg6/Text
\}Do the innocent from the outside, understand what
I write?
\n
I'm here to take good care of my daughter,
her name is Cocona.
\n
She is a kind and intelligent child.
She dared not eat her parents and was a kind and
innocent person.
She's the only innocent person who can make good
friends.
\n
But she was too late with a good friend,
and I couldn't make it.
\n
She will be the last innocent here.
She can go out, I believe so.
\n
Innocents from the outside, please, take her in.

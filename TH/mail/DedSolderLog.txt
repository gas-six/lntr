It's the Deepones! They've attacked us again!
They keep coming from the East,
all day and night.

First came the fall of Sybaris.
Followed by refugees, then the Orkind invasion,
now Deepones?!
I haven't been home for a month since the disasters
began...
\n

A little girl named Elise asked me about the Deepones.
Her parents were killed when they were fleeing.
Such a tragedy... I felt so sorry for her.
I don't know much about the Deepones either.
\n

I'm surrounded... I'm sorry.
I'm not going to make it.
To my family, I love you.

\}How strange, I see at least one green
skinned bastard trying to cross here everyday.
But recently it's been quiet. Too quiet?
\n
Whatever, the less I have to
deal with them the better.
Tomorrow my shift will end. I'll finally go back
home and see my boy.
\n
Every time I go home, my son is bigger
He's growing up so fast.
\n
Someday he'll be taller than his own father!

I've just been deployed to the South Gate's
Campsite, this is where I'll finally get to fight
for honor.
\n
I'll actually be doing something like protecting
the innocent,
as well as earning more money and finally getting
a promotion. I can't wait to be a hero!
\n

SO MANY FUCKING BUGS... EVERYWHERE!!!
\n
A few of them even managed to crawl inside
my dick while I was asleep!
\n
\C[4]1772.2.8\C[0]
My stomach's been getting fatter.
And I'm constantly hungry...
I can feel the fuckers inside me crawling
in my intestines...
\n

The priests of the Saint told us we need to
use young girls in order to purify and cure
our bodies.

\}I can feel them moving inside my body...
Every time I fall asleep, they call to me.
They keep telling me to become a part of
their "meat wall".
\n
\n
I'm not gonna let that happen to me.

\}We've been left behind.
The others must think
we're already dead, huh?
\n
\n
Is my commander really forcing me to go
find help out there?
Fine, staying here is a death sentence anyway.
\n
\n
We're surrounded!
We have no food and there's nothing
but monsters everywhere.
Mama, I'm sorry. Your son won't be
coming back home.

Orkind/OrkindDestroyed1_ClearnNoerOrkindQuest
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[map_guards]Due to the actions and diligence of the Mercenary Guild, the number of Orkinds around the Town of Noer had decreased significantly.
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[map_region_PlainField]According to eyewitnesses and rumors, there was a thin and \c[4]flat-chested\c[0] girl among the mercenary ranks.
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[map_region_PlainField]However...
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[map_monster_camp]Of course, the results of their efforts were just temporary.
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[map_NoerGate]The Orkinds' powerful reproduction speed allowed them to replace their dead almost immediately. Soon, Noer Town was once again surrounded by the green-skinned monsters.
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[map_region_PlainField]So what kind of fate awaits the Orkinds?

Orkind/OrkindDestroyed2
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[event_OrkindGonnaRape]They raped any creature they saw.
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[map_monster_camp]They consumed anything and everything in their path.
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[map_monster_camp]In the end... Their unnatural reproduction speed caused them to overpopulate.
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[map_monster_camp]The Orkinds were soon forced to gnaw on the flesh of the Abominations. Eventually, they even resorted to eating their own kind to survive.
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[map_region_badland]After a few years, the green-skinned monsters joined their prey and completely disappeared from Noer Island...

\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[event_menses]Thanks to the might of their shamans, the Fishkinds' reproduction problem had finally been solved.
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[event_menses]The Fishkinds no longer needed to rely on another species' females. They finally became a race equal to other intelligent creatures.
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[event_FishPlane]In 1812, an elderly Fishman successfully traveled around the world in a homemade aircraft know as a Biplane.
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[event_FishPlane]His book, For Father and Uncle Bubba, is a best-seller to this day.

FishKind/FishKindDestroyed3
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[map_region_NoerRoad]At first, the Fishmen thought they could live on Noer Island forever.
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[map_region_badland]But, they forgot that Noer Island had been completely abandoned.
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[map_region_AbanbonedHouse]Thus, their Goddess had also forsaken them.
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[map_region_AbanbonedHouse]Without other females or a way to reproduce, the Fishkind tribes were facing a crisis.
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[map_region_AbanbonedHouse]No matter how much they pleaded and prayed, the Sea Witch remained silent.
\SndLib[sys_DialogBoard]\cg[map_region_AbanbonedHouse]Within a few decades, the Fishkind species disappeared into history.

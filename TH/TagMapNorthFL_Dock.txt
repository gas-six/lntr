\CBid[-1,20]\SETpl[Mreg_pikeman]\Lshake\prf\c[4]guard：\c[0]    I was just a fruit seller before, but now I'm a full-time beater of blind people.
\CBid[-1,20]\SETpl[Mreg_pikeman]\Lshake\prf\c[4]guard：\c[0]    I'll kill a blind person any day.
\CBid[-1,20]\SETpl[Mreg_pikeman]\Lshake\prf\c[4]guard：\c[0]    Don't blame me, this is work!

Guard1/Com1
\CBid[-1,20]\SETpl[Mreg_pikeman]\Lshake\prf\c[4]guard：\c[0]    Are you here to sell, or to cause trouble? You want to die?

Guard2/Com0
\CBid[-1,20]\SETpl[Mreg_pikeman]\Lshake\prf\c[4]guard：\c[0]    Let me tell you, those nobles used to bully us when they had nothing to do.
\CBid[-1,20]\SETpl[Mreg_pikeman]\Lshake\prf\c[4]guard：\c[0]    Especially who is that?... I forgot the name...
\CBid[-1,20]\SETpl[Mreg_pikeman]\Lshake\prf\c[4]guard：\c[0]    But when I saw him a few days ago, he actually brought his wife and children together to beg for food.
\CBid[-1,20]\SETpl[Mreg_pikeman]\Lshake\prf\c[4]guard：\c[0]    Then can you guess what I did?
\CBid[-1,20]\SETpl[Mreg_pikeman]\Lshake\prf\c[4]guard：\c[0]    I anally fucked his whining bitch son in front of the guy, and it felt so good to see his begging and desperate expression.
\CBid[-1,20]\SETpl[Mreg_pikeman]\Lshake\prf\c[4]guard：\c[0]    Then, guess what?
\CBid[-1,20]\SETpl[Mreg_pikeman]\Lshake\prf\c[4]guard：\c[0]    He actually knelt down and begged me to let his son go, he offered himself up instead.
\CBid[-1,20]\SETpl[Mreg_pikeman]\Lshake\prf\c[4]guard：\c[0]    Then, guess what?
\CBid[-1,20]\SETpl[Mreg_pikeman]\Lshake\prf\c[4]guard：\c[0]    He is a nobleman, so of course we must listen to him. I stopped raping the brat. Then the entire team took the entire family to bed and later threw them into the sea to drown!

\board[Are you a man?]
Want to save your friends and family?!
Join the army or become a slave!
If you join, one person of your choice will be guaranteed entry to Noer Town.
Please contact the salt field guard team.

\board[Should you resist?]
A slap in the face can't make a difference. If a woman is raped, she is at greater fault than the man.
Can one palm clap make a difference? I don't think so.
If you are raped, it's more your fault than the man's.
You should shut up and not resist. It is your fault that you die because of your resistance.
If you really want to survive, you should kindly call those who want to rape you master and beg them to rape you.
This is a critical moment for human existence, and we don’t have time to listen to your tragic stories.

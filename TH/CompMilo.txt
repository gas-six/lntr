\BonMP[Milo,20]\CamMP[Milo]\SETpl[MiloAngry]\Lshake\prf\c[4]Milo：\c[0]    As you know, the Rudesind estate controls the upper class.

Milo/elseBegin_Noer
\BonMP[Milo,20]\CamMP[Milo]\SETpl[MiloAngry]\Lshake\prf\c[4]Milo：\c[0]    Like the name of this island, Noer Island.
\BonMP[Milo,20]\CamMP[Milo]\SETpl[MiloNormal]\Lshake\prf\c[4]Milo：\c[0]    This was the earliest populated place on the island, and it was built bit by bit by our family.
\BonMP[Milo,20]\CamMP[Milo]\SETpl[MiloNormal]\Lshake\prf\c[4]Milo：\c[0]    This used to be the main trading port for the East-West naval trade.
\BonMP[Milo,20]\CamMP[Milo]\SETpl[MiloNormal]\Lshake\prf\c[4]Milo：\c[0]    Sybaris was built with the intention of replacing this city.
\BonMP[Milo,20]\CamMP[Milo]\SETpl[MiloAngry]\Lshake\prf\c[4]Milo：\c[0]    And the plague in Noer decades ago accelerated that.

\BonMP[Milo,20]\CamMP[Milo]\SETpl[MiloAngry]\Lshake\prf\c[4]Milo：\c[0]    We don't have a deep-water port, Noer Town can't bear the increasing sea trade demand.

\BonMP[Milo,20]\CamMP[Milo]\SETpl[MiloNormal]\Lshake\prf\c[4]Milo：\c[0]    Around 70 years ago a city was founded by business representatives all over the world.
\BonMP[Milo,20]\CamMP[Milo]\SETpl[MiloNormal]\Lshake\prf\c[4]Milo：\c[0]    The city of Sybaris.
\BonMP[Milo,20]\CamMP[Milo]\SETpl[MiloAngry]\Lshake\prf\c[4]Milo：\c[0]    And yes, our family was also involved, but everything has gone to dust now.
